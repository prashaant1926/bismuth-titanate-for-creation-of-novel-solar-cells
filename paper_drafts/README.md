# Paper Drafts

This folder contains draft versions of research papers.

## Organization

- Use descriptive filenames with version numbers (e.g., `quantum_climate_v1.md`)
- Keep older versions for reference
- Use markdown format for easy collaboration
- Include author notes and TODOs inline

## Writing Tips

- Start with the bit flip in your introduction
- Clearly state assumptions being challenged
- Use the Problem → Assumption → Insight → Validation flow
- Connect back to broader impact
