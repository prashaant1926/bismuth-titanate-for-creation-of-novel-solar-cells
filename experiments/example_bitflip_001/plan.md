# Experiment Plan: Example Bit Flip

## Experiment Idea
### Title
*Give your experiment a clear, descriptive title*

### Bit (Problem)
*What is the fundamental problem or assumption you're addressing?*

### Flip (Solution)
*How are you solving it differently? What assumption are you challenging?*

### Hypothesis
*What specific outcome do you expect from this flip?*

## Evaluation Plan
### Metrics
*What will you measure to validate your hypothesis?*
- Primary metric:
- Secondary metrics:

### Baseline
*What are you comparing against?*

### Data Collection
*How will you collect the necessary data?*
