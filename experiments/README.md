# Experiments

This folder contains all research experiments.

## Structure

Each experiment should have its own folder named: `{shorthand}_{number}`

Example: `qnn_001` for "Quantum Neural Network experiment 1"

Each experiment folder contains:
- `plan.md` - Hypothesis, methods, expected outcomes
- `result.md` - Actual results and analysis
- `run/` - Code and scripts to execute the experiment
- `analysis/` - Analysis code and notebooks

## Best Practices

- Document your bit flip hypothesis clearly
- Track all parameters and configurations
- Save raw data and processed results
- Include negative results - they're valuable!
